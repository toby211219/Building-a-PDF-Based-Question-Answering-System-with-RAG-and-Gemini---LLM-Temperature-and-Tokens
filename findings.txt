1. Findings from the Temperature experiment:

In my experiment, I adjusted the temperature parameter from 0.0 to 1.0 and observed the model's response to the same prompt "Please explain how the generative AI model learns and creates content based on general knowledge?"

Impact on model output:

I found that temperature has a direct and significant impact on the randomness and repetitiveness of the model's output. When temperature is set to low values ​​such as 0.0 and 0.2, the answers generated by the model are very similar, with almost repeated beginnings and structures. This indicates that the model tends to choose the words with the highest probability.

As the temperature value increases to 0.8 and 1.0, the model's output becomes more diverse and creative. Although the topic content of the answer is still about the explanation of generative AI, the specific wording, sentence structure, and details of the explanation begin to show obvious differences. In my experiment, the high-temperature answers used different metaphors or richer descriptions when explaining the concept.

Scenarios for choosing high or low temperatures:

Low temperature applications (e.g. 0.0 - 0.3): Suitable for scenarios that require stable, predictable, factually accurate, and highly reproducible content. For example, extracting key information from PDFs, summarizing data, generating code, or question-answering systems that require standardized responses. In such scenarios, we want the model to "stick to the facts" and avoid any divergent thinking.

High temperature applications (e.g. 0.7 - 1.0): Suitable for scenarios that require creativity, diversity, brainstorming, or generating different versions of content. For example, writing assistance, generating stories, poems, marketing copy, or open-ended questions that require exploring multiple solutions. If you ask an open-ended question and want more diverse explanations, high temperature may help.

The most obvious change I observed was that starting from temperature 0.5, the model began to produce more changes in the internal structure and expression of the answer, no longer the almost identical beginning and logical development at low temperature. For example, changes in subheadings or more detailed explanation layers began to appear in the answer.



2. Max Output Tokens Experimental Findings:

I experimented with different max_output_tokens values ​​(20, 50, 100, 200, 400) and observed the impact of the model's output length for the prompt "Please explain in detail the working principle, advantages, challenges of the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system, and explain how it differs from traditional LLM applications."

Impact on model output length:

max_output_tokens directly and precisely determines the upper limit of the length of text generated by the model. When the set number of tokens is reached, the model immediately stops generating, even if it has not yet completed the entire answer or a complete sentence.

At low token limits (such as 20 and 50), the answers are severely truncated and even fail to form a complete concept, such as only the title and an incomplete sentence. This leads to severe loss of information and difficulty in understanding.

As the number of tokens increases (such as 200 and 400), the model is able to generate more and more complete and detailed answers. When the number of tokens reaches 400, the model can clearly explain the working principle of RAG and its core components, but it still cannot fully answer all the questions in the prompt (such as advantages, challenges, and differences from traditional LLM), which indicates that the original question needs more tokens to be fully answered.

In the system, it is crucial to control max_output_tokens. It can prevent the model from generating lengthy and unnecessary content, ensure that the answers are concise and concise, and directly hit the user's questions.

It also helps to adapt to different front-end display restrictions. For example, if your chat interface or application has a limit on the length of a single message, max_output_tokens can ensure that the output does not overflow.

And shorter answers usually mean lower API costs and faster response times, which is very beneficial for real-time Q&A systems in production environments.



3. Summary and Conclusion:

temperature mainly affects the creativity, randomness, and output diversity of the model.

max_output_tokens directly determines the upper limit of the model's output length.

I think the most ideal combination of "temperature" and "max output tokens" is (0.8,50). At a high temperature, the model will try to express itself in a more imaginative and less direct way, while a low token count will ensure that this creative expression is compressed into a concise length without any unnecessary details or redundant information.
